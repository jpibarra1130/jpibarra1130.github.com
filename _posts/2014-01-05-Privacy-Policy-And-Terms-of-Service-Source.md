I did not realize that creating your website wherein you intend to get contributions from people could be a little complicated. I was about to release it when I realized I don\'t even have a Terms of Service, nor a Privacy Policy.

Where do you get those anyway? Is it something you make up? Do I need to hire a lawyer (omg) for this?

After googling a while, I came across Wordpress\' [Terms of Service](http://en.wordpress.com/tos/) which they have shared with us. I also saw Automattic\'s [Privacy Policy](http://automattic.com/privacy/). I reckon I need to tweak this more but at least, this would be a good start.
