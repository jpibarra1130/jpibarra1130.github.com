I have been working on Ruby on Rails on and off for close to a year now. And just recently, I have thought about this idea for a website and opted to use Ruby on Rails for it. Along the way, I realized that my knowledge about Ruby is still not broad enough, and quite scattered. I know how certain methods or classes act but there are still a lot of things I don't understand about it. I decided that I wanted to learn more about the language, and really **understand** it.

I thought that the best way to go about it is to search for the most recently published book about Ruby, and read it. I ended up choosing [Programming Ruby 1.9 & 2.0: The Pragmatic Programmers' Guide (The Facets of Ruby)](http://www.amazon.com/Programming-Ruby-1-9-2-0-Programmers/dp/1937785491) for this.

In my opinion, this has been an effective way of learning Ruby. I have only finished a few chapters but I am able to learn new things about the language, and understand why certain features "magically" work.

Kudos to the authors of the book for organising and explaining the concepts effectively.
