It is finally live! My first ever website. There's something absolutely wonderful in seeing your own idea go live. I have done freelancing jobs before where I had to create something from scratch. And I am working at a company right now developing different features. But I got to tell you this, seeing your own idea live gives you a different kind of high. Because you can finally say that you created something of your own.

I have always wanted to create a product or an application but I somehow managed to talk myself out of doing so. Either I ended up convincing myself that my idea wasn't good enough, or that it might be too complicated that I wasn't ready to do it. I talked to my CEO once and he got me thinking when he said that it should be easier for me to create a product because I should know how to build stuff. I realized that my overthinking is just holding me back. If there's something complicated that I find in the product I was thinking of, then it's fine, I'll manage to simplify it. If there's a difficult bug I encounter, then I'll do the same thing I've done with all other issues I have encountered - find a solution for it. At the end of the day, I realized you just have to go for it. Think of one thing you are passionate in and try to intersect it with technology.

It would be great if it becomes the next big thing. If it isn't then tough luck. But so what? What's the worst thing that could happen? If it becomes super popular then good for you! If it doesn't then it ends up in your portfolio and you have learned something new.

Right now, I am just extremely happy that I have released my website. A website that I hope would help other people in the LGBT community. It is something I am passionate in. It's my way of helping out my community as a gay developer.

There is still a lot of things I need to do. I need to add some tracking. Add new features. Refactor some of the codes. Get content and users. But right now, I'm just extremely happy that I pushed my website to live. Seeing that page load for the first time under the domain name I chose - it's a pretty darn cool feeling.

Here's a quote I find really inspiring. We, as developers, have the skillset to actually achieve this.
