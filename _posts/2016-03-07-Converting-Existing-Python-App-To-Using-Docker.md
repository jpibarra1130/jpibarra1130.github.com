I wrote a simple API using Python and Django to feed data for the project I am working on. I was thinking of tinkering with Docker for some time now. I've used it in some of my work projects but I haven't really set one up. I thought that I would try dockerizing the existing project that I have just to try it out.

But where to start?

After searching the internet for a good tutorial for this, I ended up following this [article from the Real Python](https://realpython.com/blog/python/django-development-with-docker-compose-and-machine/).

I used it as a reference to convert my project.
