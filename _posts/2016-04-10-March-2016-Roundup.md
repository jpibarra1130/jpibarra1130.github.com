Here's the roundup for March.

  - Began looking into [iOS development](https://www.udemy.com/ios9-swift/).
  - Dockerized my local project thanks to this [article from the Real Python](https://realpython.com/blog/python/django-development-with-docker-compose-and-machine/).
  - Books:
    - Finished
      - [Rework by Jason Fried](http://www.amazon.com/Rework-Jason-Fried/dp/0307463745)
    - Currently Reading:
      - [Thinking, Fast and Slow by Daniel Kahneman](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11468377-thinking-fast-and-slow)
  - Travel:
    - I had to fly to UK for work last March. I took some time off to visit London and meet up with a couple of my friends. I stayed in Edinburgh for roughly 2 weeks. I had a great time in both cities. I went at the right time. It was still cold but not too much. And the sun was mostly out (which apparently was a rarity according to the people I talked to - so I guess I'm lucky).
      - [London, England](https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.10205975575092937.1073741851.1367047016&type=1&l=cfdd93b61f)
